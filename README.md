# Capstone 1 
 This project is intended to show the user a set of transactions that have been made. This is significant because we use programs like this everyday like at an atm machine or on a mobile banking app. One special feature I believe that stands out on my project is the ability to search up a transaction by the date. I find the be beyond useful in real world scenarios. One future feature I would add on to this program would be the ability to dispute a transactions. Such as in a method of a fragulent charge. I would to thank my classmates for assisting me in the process of creating this. As well as our instructor Raymond for being able to help me with things I didn't comprehend well.
