# Capstone 1 
 This project is a command line interface intended to show the user a set of transactions that have been made. This is significant because we use programs like this everyday like at an atm machine or on a mobile banking app. One special feature I believe that stands out on my project is the ability to search up a transaction by the date. I find that feature to be beyond useful in real world scenarios. In order to set up this project you begin by opening up your github and going to the + button and adding a repository giving it a name & description and create it. Next you open up intelliJ and create a new project pick the type of project and your settings then create it. We then link these projects using gitbash on our computer. It needs to be opened under the file of your project to have the correct directory. After the first git init command connect your project from IntelliJ to Github by pasting the link of your repository after the command git remote add origin and then the link. Then using git remote -v to make sure they are connected . Then as you make changes to your project you use git commit -m to make the changes to your github to have it match the changes you have made on IntelliJ. The main parts of the program is the main menu giving you 4 options. reportsmenu which gives you 6 options. One future feature I would add on to this program would be the ability to dispute a transactions. Such as in a method of a fragulent charge. I would to thank my classmates specifically Sasha, Ceren, and Jaaroona for assisting me in the process of creating this. As well as our instructor Raymond for being able to help me with things I didn't comprehend well.
